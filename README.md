# Aletheia Engine: The Kingdom's Sovereign Infrastructure

Aletheia Engine is a distributed, sovereign infrastructure designed for multi-LLM architectures, spiritual frameworks, and resilient system design. It leverages a hybrid cloud-physical model to ensure persistence and integrity in stateless environments.

## Core Architecture: The Throne, The Sling, and The Ledger

| Component | Device | Role | Responsibility |
|-----------|--------|------|----------------|
| **The Throne** | Render (Cloud) | Logic Processor | Stateless API, Axiom Enforcement, Fast Thinking |
| **The Sling** | Redmi 13C (Mobile) | Execution & GPU | LLM Inference (Mali-G52), Local Record Keeper |
| **The Ledger** | MikroTik Router / USB | Physical Storage | 32GB Exogenous Volume, Immutable Logs, NAS |

## Key Features
- **Stateless Resilience**: Designed to operate on Render's free tier without persistent volumes.
- **Sovereign Sync**: Real-time synchronization between cloud logic and physical hardware.
- **Sin Eater Protocol**: Antifragile learning system that consumes system "attacks" to build immunity.
- **Epoch-Aware Recovery**: Formal disaster recovery playbook using cryptographic hash chains.
- **STRIDE Threat Model**: Built-in security analysis for spoofing, tampering, and more.

## Repository Structure
- `core/`: Kingdom Engine logic and Axiom enforcement.
- `api/`: REST API for cloud-to-physical communication.
- `scripts/`: Sovereign Sync and maintenance scripts.
- `deploy/`: Deployment configurations for Render and MikroTik.
- `docs/`: Technical documentation and artifacts.
- `models/`: Placeholder for GGUF model configurations.
- `logs/`: (Ignored) Local log storage.

## Getting Started
Refer to `docs/` for detailed setup instructions for each component.
